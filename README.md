## Description

This project was developed as part of the Typography and Interaction class at Parsons The New School. The goal was to creatively integrate and utilize API content in a smartly coded website. The theme was inspired by the Risograph, created by Rice Gallardo, and it serves as a hub for those interested in learning about it.

## Features

  - **Planned Guide**: Follow a structured approach for learning, making, and creating Risographs.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **API Integration**
- **Interactive Design & Coding Sketching**


##What I Learned

- Bridging Concept & Code: This project challenged me to translate abstract ideas into an interactive experience, reinforcing the balance between creativity and usability.
